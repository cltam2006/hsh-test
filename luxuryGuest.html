There is increased attention towards the safety and security of our hotel staff in Chicago, especially those with shifts concluding in the evening. Our responsibilities to our colleagues do not stop even when they leave work and our premises. To ensure our hotel staff can travel safely home after work, the security team helps escort staff members to either their vehicles or to public transportation once they conclude their shifts. The hotel has even prepared additional vehicles to help escort staff to safety should they need to travel for longer distances. We also enhanced our security hardware and increased surveillance cameras around the hotel exterior. Additional training was arranged to allow our staff to be incident-ready and able to respond to emergency situations, these include Active Shooter Training and Self-defence and De-escalation Training.</span></div>',

Nearly half of our operations feature gym facilities or gym memberships, and some also provide relaxation areas for employees to unwind and recharge.

Each year, students are paired with a colleague who provides mentorship, support and guidance throughout the internship period. This programme allows for students to work closely with our colleagues, connecting people from different background and perspectives, and offering an opportunity to learn from each other&rsquo;s differences. Prior to the students&rsquo; internship period, we organise culture tours in partnership with our NGO partners to deepen our colleagues&rsquo; understanding of Hong Kong&rsquo;s diverse ethnic communities, their history and cultural practices. Through such activities, we aim to foster mutual understanding to create an inclusive workplace where everyone can thrive.&nbsp;</span></p>\n</div>',
